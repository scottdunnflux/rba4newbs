## What is this?
This tool aims to speed up and simplify the process of composing intelligible rare bird alerts for Manhattan birders.

## Really? Why?
Many Manhattan birders can quickly respond to timely alerts, making these alerts valuable. Quick composition means more timely alerting.

Simplifying the composition process could encourage birders to post alerts that might otherwise seem like too much trouble.

This tool flags common species so sightings of common birds don't end up on the rare alert board.

The list of Hot Spots in Central Park is extensive, and not everyone has the entire list memorized. This tool knows the proper name and location of every Hot Spot and will help ensure that birders enter the correct name and identify the correct location.

The tool also makes it easy to mark a location with a pin. This can help with larger hot spots or with locations that fall outside of a hot spot or outside of Central Park.

## How does it work?
Click the link at the end of this list to open the Manhattan Bird Alert Assistant web page.

Once on that page:
1. Enter a full or partial text for bird species.
   For example, for Swainson's Warbler the following text could be entered:
   - "Swainson's Warbler"
   - "Swa wa"
   - "swwa" (standard 4-letter abbreviation)
   - "Swain War"
   - "Limnothlypis swainsonii"
2. Select the correct species from the autocomplete list
3. Click "Next"
4. Choose a location using one of the available methods:
   - Type and select a known hotspot. Partial words accepted here as well.
   - Use "Near Me" to find nearby hotspots
   - Enter a custom location or map URL
   - Use Set Map Pin button to create a custom pin
5. Copy the generated alert text which will include pin URLs
6. Tap the appropriate Discord channel link to open Discord
7. Paste the alert text and customize further if necessary
